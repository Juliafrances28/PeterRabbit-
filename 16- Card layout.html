                Feed a rabbit a carrot? I have always loved rabbits ever since I
                was a kid. My favorite well-loved childhood stuffed animal was
                Peter Rabbit from the story "A Tale of Peter Rabbit" by Beatrix
                Potter. My home is filled with rabbit items. My aunt did some
                paintings for my apartment. One of them is the Alice in
                Wonderland rabbit statue in Central Park. "I'm late, I'm late,
                for a very important date." On my nightstand along with some
                books are bunny bookends my sister gave me for my birthday this
                year. On my windowsill is a set of pewter rabbits I found in a
                knickknack store.
